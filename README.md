# Rochambeau


This is my version of the Odin Project's Rock Paper Scissors assignment project.  Creating this project I learned how to use functions, and variable assignments.  I know the code is a bit messy and I can use loops to clean it up, but I haven't learned loops yet.  

The app creates a 5 round rock paper scissors game.  The user is asked to input rock, paper, or scissors at the begnning of each round.
